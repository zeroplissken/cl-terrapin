= Terrapin, not turtle
--------------------

Terrapin is just a project to make non-realtime turtle graphics with common lisp. By non realtime I mean
I can't be bothered to deal with SDL2 right now so I'm just rendering it all to a .png. It uses Vecto 
under the flimsy hood.

I'm making this as a way to dip a single toe into CLOS, packaging a system, and also so I can work through 
https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510370/turtle-geometry/[Turtle Geometry by Harold Abelson and Andrea A. diSessa.] I have some ideas for further down the road,
depending on how much I enjoy this method of drawing squiggles.

go terps btw
