= Terrapin, not turtle
--------------------

Terrapin is just a quick thing to make non-realtime turtle graphics with common lisp. 

By non realtime I mean I can't be bothered to deal with SDL2 right now so I'm just rendering it all to a .png. It uses https://www.xach.com/lisp/vecto/[Vecto] under the flimsy hood.

I'm making this so I can work through https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510370/turtle-geometry/[Turtle Geometry by Harold Abelson and Andrea A. diSessa]. I have some ideas for further down the road, depending on how much I enjoy this method of drawing squiggles.

== Usage

Call ``(init <width> <height> <output path>)`` first. Then use ``(terp-go @body)`` to direct your terrapin around the canvas. You can use ``(forward <steps>), (back <steps>), (left <angle>), (right <angle>),`` ``(pen-up)/(pen-down),`` and ``(toggle-pen)``.

A list of advanced commands can be found https://novaspec.org/cl/[here].
