= Terrapin, not turtle
--------------------

Terrapin is just a project to make non-realtime turtle graphics with common lisp. By non realtime I mean
I can't be bothered to deal with SDL2 right now so I'm just rendering it all to a .png. It uses https://www.xach.com/lisp/vecto/[Vecto] under the flimsy hood.

I'm making this as a way to dip a single toe into CLOS, packaging a system, and also so I can work through 
https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510370/turtle-geometry/[Turtle Geometry by Harold Abelson and Andrea A. diSessa.] I have some ideas for further down the road, depending on how much I enjoy this method of drawing squiggles.

Usage
-------
Call ``(init <width> <height> <output path.png>)`` first. Then use the ``terp-go`` macro.
Basic commands are ``(forward _steps_)``, ``(back _steps_)``, ``(left _degrees_)``, (right _degrees_)``, and ``(toggle-pen)``.

A list of advanced commands can be found https://novaspec.org[here].

go terps btw
